## Overview

<a href="#">Hookmark for macOS</a> is centred on the idea that work rarely lives in a single file or location. A research report might span PDFs, emails, notes and web articles; a project might involve tickets, design assets and reference documents. Hookmark lets you create links between these resources so you can jump among them without repeatedly searching or digging through folders. A small interface appears over whatever you are working on, giving you quick access to existing hooks or options to create new ones.

The linking model is intentionally flexible. You can connect documents to each other, attach notes to web pages or create hubs around key artefacts like specifications or contracts. These connections can be revisited later, turning Hookmark into a memory layer over your normal file system and applications. With <a href="#">keyboard shortcuts and system-wide availability</a>, the tool encourages link creation during natural work, not as a separate filing task at the end of the day. As links accumulate, related items become one shortcut away wherever you are on your Mac.

On macOS, Hookmark integrates with many popular apps so that links feel native rather than bolted on. It respects privacy and local storage and avoids imposing its own storage model. For people who manage complex knowledge work, it becomes the connective tissue that holds disparate pieces together, making context easier to recover after interruptions or long project gaps.
